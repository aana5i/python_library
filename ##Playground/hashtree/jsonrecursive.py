1.	The client connects to the OTA server from the platformâ€™s OTA server info request
2.	The client downloads the merkle tree from that repo
3.	The client traverses sub folders of the merkle trees, comparing the root hashes of each folder and only continuing in comparison when they mismatch
4.	Each folder contains files and subfolders that are sorted; therefore the comparison is O(N), where by the ith data item in each folder should either:
a.	Match name, match CRC (hash), file is ignored
b.	Match name, but mismatch CRC (hash), which adds the file to the change list as an UPDATE action
c.	Mismatch name, unknown asset exists on server, which adds the file to the change list as ADD action
d.	Mismatch name, unknown asset exists on the client, which adds the file to the change list as DELETE action
